This is my implementation of Project 1.

First, run 'make' to create the executable 'driver'
Next, I suggest running './driver -h'

Disclaimer:
Some basic code was taken from other sources, such as creating the time and printing
it to the terminal. I do not claim that 100% of this code belongs to me.
However, I do claim that my implementation of the code I have used is all my
creation. I did not collaborate with anyone to create the functionality of the
program. I used online sources to gather some basic code.
